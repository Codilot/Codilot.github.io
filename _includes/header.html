          Hackergarden combines tech 💻 with growing crops 🍅. It’s a place
          where we explore web and IoT technologies to support our cultivating
          process 🌱 in a sustainable way. In our 400 qm garden we want to
          preserve as many open-pollinated 🐝 organic vegetable varieties as
          possible by growing them regularly and share the seeds with others.
