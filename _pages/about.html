        The allotment garden has about 421 square meter. When we took over the
        garden in 2017 it was used as a recreational garden. Fortunate it had
        some really nice elderly fruit trees: an apricot tree, a plum tree,
        three peach trees, two old wine shrubs and some bushes of red and black
        currant. The rest was planted with mostly with decorative plants and
        hybrid flowers. In the last three years we created for about 150 square
        meter of vegetable beds and planted five gooseberry bushes, two more
        wine shrubs, two korean cherry trees (Prunus tomentosa), four hardy kiwi
        berry bushes, a serviceberry (Amelanchier) and a lot of bee-friendly
        perennials.
