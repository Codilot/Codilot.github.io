Other common names include garden rocket (in Britain, Australia, South Africa, Ireland and New Zealand), and eruca. It is also called "ruchtetta", "rucola", "rucoli", "rugula", "colewort", and "roquette". Eruca sativa, which is widely popular as a salad vegetable, is a species of Eruca native to the Mediterranean region, from Morocco and Portugal in the west to Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey in the east.

Eruca vesicaria is an annual plant growing to 20–100 cm (8–39 in) in height. The pinnate leaves are deeply lobed with four to ten small lateral lobes and a large terminal lobe. The flowers are 2–4 cm (0.8–1.6 in) in diameter, arranged in a corymb, with the typical Brassicaceae flower structure. The petals are creamy white with purple veins, and the stamens yellow. The fruit is a siliqua (pod) 12–25 mm (0.5–1.4 in) long with an apical beak, containing several seeds (which are edible).
